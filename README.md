4. Return the age of a human in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)

5. Return the age of a human in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)

6. Return the age of a human in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)

7. Determine how many years a user has left to live on each planet

8. If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, return the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy.
